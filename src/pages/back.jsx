        <h1>07. A way to give back</h1>
        <p>The planet gives us so much as mentioned before. 
            It only seems fair if we do something to show some appreciation.
             From food to water, the earth is able to replenish its resources and it keeps giving us more. 
             To me, it seems logical to care about the environment. 
             In fact, it should be instinct. Unfortunately, most have lost that by being disconnected from nature for so long.

We should not have to be told not to cut down the forests or be told that we need to care for the planet. 
It is something we should already do or know.

Young children like being outside (or at least they used to be). 
They are intrigued by it and in no way do they harm it. As they grow up, 
they stop caring as much since there are bigger things to worry about in modern society.
 It should not be like this.

Every single person has some sort of impact and it is time everyone takes responsibility. 
You can not sit back and watch the earth deteriorate any longer.</p>
