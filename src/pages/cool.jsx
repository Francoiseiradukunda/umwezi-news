        <h1>03. Caring is cool</h1>
        <p>I genuinely do not understand when it became cool to throw rubbish on the street,
             or to drive or to buy plastic bottles. It seems like society believes people who care 
             about the environment are not cool people. 
             I do not know where it came from and who came up with it but it is false. 
             Caring about something and showing respect is a sign of kindness and in my books that not a bad thing. 
             Caring for the environment shows your true personality and the kind of person you are.</p>
