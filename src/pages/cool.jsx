        <h1>08. Caring is cool</h1>
        <p>I genuinely don’t understand when it became ‘cool’ to throw rubbish on the street, or to drive or to buy plastic bottles. It seems like society believes people who care about the environment are not cool people. I don’t know where it came from and who came up with it but it’s false. Caring about something and showing respect is a sign of kindness and in my books that not a bad thing. Caring for the environment shows your true personality and the kind of person you are.
