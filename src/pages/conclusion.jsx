        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Currently, there is still beautiful earth that we can admire. We can travel to different countries looking at the natural wonders. If we continue exploiting the earth there will be nothing to look at apart from dead ecosystems, Thatâ€™s not a world anyone would want to live in. Furthermore, as mentioned above nature provides us with resources some of which are finite. There will not be enough food or water for the human population in the future.

Anyway, the alternative to caring ends in our destruction and the extinction of every animal. All those millions of years of evolution taking place, wiped out by a single species.</p>
