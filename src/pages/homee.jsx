        <p>We don’t have another planet to go to. At least not yet. This is why we need to do as much as we can to protect it for us as well as future generations. Why spend billions of dollars to colonize a different planet when we could spend that same money on the restoration and protection of the one we already live on?

If forests, coral reefs, the Arctic, and everything else got destroyed by our greed, we will not be able to survive another day. We don’t have a ‘Planet B’ to go </p>
