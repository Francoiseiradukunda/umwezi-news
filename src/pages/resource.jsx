        <h1>02. Our resources</h1>
        <p>
        Everything that we need to live and survive comes from nature. The air that we breathe, our water, our food and so much more. We can not live without these.

All the resources that we use every day also need to come from somewhere. They don’t appear out of thin air. How will we build without any trees left, what will we drink after we exhaust all of the freshwater sources, and finally what will we eat when we have made soils infertile and arid?

Let’s not forget that natural medicine can also found in nature. By cutting down forests, we might be losing potential plants with healing properties.

You might think that money is more important than the environment but try spending a month in the wild with a million dollars. That money will not get you anywhere. That’s why the planet should always come first.

We like to think we are a superior race and better than other animals but when it comes down to it, we are all alike. Every organism needs the same vital resources to survive. Humans are no exception.
