        <p>We cannot leave a destroyed planet for future generations.
             It is not fair to leave them with the problems we created. 
             They did not contribute to it. It should be up to us 
             to fix the series of mistakes that we have made.

It is necessary to start acting now so our great-great-grandchildren 
do not need to pay for what we have done.</p>
