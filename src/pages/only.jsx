        <p>Like it or not, what we do to nature, inevitably affects us too because we are part of it.

Pollution, greenhouse gases, deforestation, and everything else will come back and affect us in some way. 
We built factories and now the pollution is killing thousands or even millions around the world.
 Mass deforestation is leading to biodiversity loss throwing the earth  system off balance.
  Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing climate change and sooner or later,
   everyone will be experiencing heatwaves, floods, drought, or other extreme events.

In addition, so many human infectious diseases came from domesticating animals. 
Humans decided long ago to keep animals in pens without realizing the effects it would have on us in the future. 
This is an example of what happens when we do not treat nature right. 
Animals were never meant to be domesticated. Sadly, we still have not learned that lesson. 
If we do not change our practices, there might even be a new disease outbreak from livestock in the future.

The list goes on. Even the plastic that we invented is now making its way into our bloodstream, 
hidden as microplastics.Who knows what effects this could have on our health?

As you can see, everything we do has consequences. 
It is natures way to keep the world in balance. That is why you need to care about the environment and the planet as a whole. 
When we do something harmful, nature tries to get rid of us in order to maintain a balance. Nature always wins. 
We can either fight against it and become extinct or work with it and thrive alongside it.</p>
