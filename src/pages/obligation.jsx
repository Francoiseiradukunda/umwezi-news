        <p>We need to start following our moral compass. We consume the earth food and water, 
            dig up its precious minerals and metal to build new things, 
            and cut down millions of trees.

The human race has overrun the earth. We even call it our planet as if we own it. 
With this kind of power though, also comes a responsibility to protect what we call ‘ours’.</p>
