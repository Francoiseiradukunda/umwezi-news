        <p>It might not seem important to you in your day-to-day life, 
            but the planet needs biodiversity for it to stay healthy.

Humans would not be able to survive without other animals. 
Either directly or indirectly they keep us alive. They are a source of food, 
but the huge biodiversity also keeps the earth in balance. If that does not convince you, 
maybe seeing how cute and wonderful animals are will get you to care.

Scientists believe we are currently in the 6th mass extinction. 
Humans are driving animals and plants into extinction every year. 
How would you like it if your children grew up in a world without pandas or polar bears?</p>
