        <p>You need to care because the environment is at risk from climate change, pollution, loss of biodiversity, etc. 
            And we are the cause.

Climate change is affecting ecosystems and wildlife is dying. 
For instance, coral bleaching and arctic ice melting are happening because of global warming. 
But climate change is not the only issue (although it is the biggest one). 
More environmental challenges continue to appear threatening all life on the planet.

Humans are even being displaced from their homes due to floods and fires. 
The world is seeing an increase in climate migrants and it will only continue to rise.</p>
